Nilead (from Nil to Lead)
======

The official Nilead repository. Symfony2 based shopping cart system.

Nilead is a shopping cart system built on our 5+ years of experience working with Zencart, Magento and a number of other open-source shopping cart systems.

Nilead is built for:
-------------

1. Small, medium businesses who need ecommerce system that is designed for normal (non-geek) users and just work.
2. Enterprises that need an open, extensible ecommerce system.


Nilead is built to:
-------------

Nilead concentrates on User Experience, we want to build a shopping cart system for the mass. 

Nilead is inspired by other prjects:

1. Shopify: for its business model, simple and user friendly design
2. Sylius: for its usage of Symfony2 as its core, and for many parts of its implementation of the cart system
3. Zencart, Magento, Prestashop, OpenCart, ... and many more

Why Nilead?
-------------

Nilead does not aim to be a do-it-all ecommerce system, our first and foremost target users are small and medium businesses who:

1. May not have experience with ecommerce
2. May not afford to have in-house IT team
3. May not afford the time and cost to learn a complicated system with so many features that may not be helpful for the current business

Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the format `major.minor.patch`.

And constructed with the following guidelines.

* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major.
* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor.
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch.

For more information on SemVer, please visit [semver.org website](http://semver.org/).  
This versioning method is same for all **Nilead** bundles and applications.

MIT License
----------

Nilead uses MIT license with a tweak: Nilead is used by Rubikin for our hosted ecommerce solution (which is similar to Shopify's), thus we require that any entity that wants to use Nilead for the same purpose must obtain a special license from us.
